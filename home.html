<p style= "font-size: 25px;color:white" > LDoE:S is a mobile zombie survival game from Kefir! Studios, currently in the early stages of BETA. It's similar to experiences you'll find in PC games like H1Z1, DayZ, 7 Days, ARK, etc. You play as a lone survivor in a post apocalyptic wasteland, forced to scrounge for food and shelter in a hostile environment. While not as in-depth as its PC equivalents, LDoE:S is a surprisingly deep game, even at this stage of development.

Since the game is still in BETA, and patch notes are often missing info/not given altogether, this site (and others) will be invaluable tools to help you keep up with the comings and goings of the game.</p>
